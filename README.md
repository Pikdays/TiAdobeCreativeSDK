# TiAdobeCreativeSDK
Titanium Module for photo editing using the Adobe Creative SDK (was the Aviary SDK).

Based on work by [@ludolphus](https://github.com/ludolphus/AviaryModule), [@alexshive](https://github.com/alexshive/AviaryModule), [@ghkim](https://github.com/ghkim/AviaryModule) and [@frederictedesco](https://github.com/frederictedesco/Adobe-Creative-Image-module-for-Titanium) (for the latest Adobe update)

I was getting some build errors (on the module at first, then the app) so decided to start from scratch and rename.
